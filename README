ABOUT FASTAESPIPE

fastaespipe is intended to be a drop-in replacement for aespipe (http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/) that uses the Intel AES New Instructions (AES-NI; http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-the-intel-aesni-sample-library/).  Furthermore, fastaespipe is designed to process blocks in parallel threads (using AES CTR mode) for even better performance.  The inspiration for this project is backups using Amanda and amaespipe (http://wiki.zmanda.com/man/amaespipe.8.html).

!!!! FASTAESPIPE IS PRE-ALPHA!!  IT DOES NOT WORK YET!! !!!!

INSTALLATION

fastaespipe can only be built or executed on 64-bit Intel processors that support AES-NI.  Building the AES-NI library depends on yasm (http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/wiki), which is available in some Linux distributions' repositories.  Assuming yasm is in your PATH, to compile:

make

is all you need to do, and you may put bin/fastaespipe wherever you like.  A typical use case is to replace your current aespipe with a symlink to fastaespipe.
