aespipe-v1.0b     May 14 2002
    - First release to public

aespipe-v2.0a     October 18 2002
    - IV computation now wraps back to zero at 2^137 bytes instead of 2^41
      bytes (2 TB). First 2 TB is fully compatible with v1.0 version.
    - Added '-K file' and '-G dir' command line options to enable use of
      GnuPG encrypted key files.

aespipe-v2.1a     December 26 2002
    - Added ./configure for better portability.
    - Removed dependence of OpenSSL RIPE-MD160 library function by including
      rmd160.[ch] files (copied from GnuPG package).
    - Added mlockall() to prevent key leak to swap.
    - Added '-C nnn' command line option that iterates encryption key nnn
      thousand times through AES-256.

aespipe-v2.1b     June 4 2003
    - Added man page for aespipe.
    - Minimum password length is now configurable at compile time.

aespipe-v2.1c     September 8 2003
    - bz2aespipe script rewritten to use unique random seed for each
      encrypted archive. This version of bz2aespipe script is not compatible
      with earlier headerless version.
    - Man page now explains input file size padding (so that people
      hopefully stop reporting this feature as a bug).

aespipe-v2.2a     November 29 2003
    - Added support for MD5 IV computation and multi-key operation that
      reduce chances of identical ciphertexts and triggers change to all
      cipher blocks in 512 byte CBC chain if any bit is changed in the 512
      byte CBC chain. MD5 IV is only used in multi-key mode, read aespipe -K
      man page for more details.
    - When aespipe attempts to run gpg, and does not find gpg in obvious
      locations, aespipe attempts to run gpg from same dir that aespipe was
      run from.

aespipe-v2.2b     February 11 2004
    - Tiny speed optimization in MD5 IV computation.
    - Automatic detection of weirdo gpg program location.

aespipe-v2.2c     April 22 2004
    - Added back aes.c code that avoids byte swaps on big endian boxes. This
      change improves performance on all non-x86 computers.
    - Security fix: restrict length of passphrase to max 4094 bytes when it
      is read from file descriptor using "aespipe -p 3" option.
    - Removed strip command from Makefile.in -- didn't work on solaris

aespipe-v2.2d     July 7 2004
    - Added optimized assembler implementations of AES and MD5 functions for
      AMD64 and compatible processors.
    - Pentium-2 optimized assembler implementations of AES and MD5 are
      really i386 compatible, so now those assembler implementations are
      enabled for all x86 processors.

aespipe-v2.2e     August 21 2004
    - Added multi-key compatibility to -p command line option handling.

aespipe-v2.3a     November 26 2004
    - Added support for loop-AES version 3 on-disk format.

aespipe-v2.3b     March 18 2005
    - Changed gpg pipe code to use '--no-options' instead of '--options
      /dev/null'. Fix from Lars Packschies.
    - Changed aespipe to warn about unknown key data format.

aespipe-v2.3c     October 28 2006
    - Changed aespipe program to output error message if gpg program does
      not exist when gpg encrypted key file is used.

aespipe-v2.3d     February 23 2007
    - Added compatibility for two obsolete key setup methods, "-H unhashed1"
      and "-H unhashed2". Patch from Jordan Ritter.
    - Added "-P file" command line option.

aespipe-v2.3e     October 28 2008
    - Added -A option for gpg-agent usage. Patch from Richard Davies.
    - Passphrase handling code cleanup.

aespipe-v2.4b     June 3 2010
    - Added DESTDIR make variable for "make install DESTDIR=/tmp/root", and
      support for separate build directory (mkdir xx; cd xx; ../configure).
      Patch from Alon Bar-Lev.
    - Added faster (single thread) parallelized version of MD5 for amd64.
    - Added support for VIA padlock hardware AES.
    - Added support for Intel hardware AES.
    - Added x86/amd64/padlock/intelaes auto-detections to ./configure
      script, and these options to override its guesses: --disable-asm
      --enable-asm=x86 --enable-asm=amd64 --enable-padlock --disable-padlock
      --enable-intelaes --disable-intelaes
